There are people and creatures everywhere, bustling to and fro. While the cacophony nearly deafens you, it is the smell that draws you in. The intoxicating aroma wafting from a nearby shipment of spice overwhelms your senses. But what wonders there are to behold. To your left, a person with blue skin catches your eye as they dart through the crowd. To your right, a large creature is reluctantly goaded toward the ship. Suddenly, it shucks its bonds and charges off, smashing through the spice shipment, throwing boxes everywhere, and spilling the precious spice. Do you chase after the blue-skinned stranger, do you grab one of the cases of spice and run away, or do you help to gather and preserve the spice, helping the poor soul crying over the mess?
