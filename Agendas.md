## Creating an Alexa Skill - Beyond Hello World

In this session, we will create a simple, but not trivial, Alexa Skill.

First, we'll discuss the nature of our skill and define a few requirements.
Second, we'll step through the creation of a custom Alexa Skill using the Alexa Developer Console.
Third, we'll discuss the selection of a launch phrase.
Fourth, we'll consider the intents that we need to fulfill. This discussion includes defining slots.
Fifth, we'll write the utterances that will trigger our intents.

At the end of the hour, we will have created a basic skill.
